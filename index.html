            <p>
               Calluna vulgaris, common heather, ling, or simply heather, is the sole species in the genus Calluna in the flowering plant family Ericaceae. 
               It is the dominant plant in most heathland and moorland in Europe, and in some bog vegetation and acidic pine and oak woodland.
               Heather flower is tolerant of grazing and regenerates following occasional burning.
